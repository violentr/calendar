# Mostrous controller action refactor

### Your task is simple.

Refactor the monstrous action in BookingsController and write specs for it.

You can use any pattern you want (Queries, ServiceObjects, UseCases, etc.), but please don't use any external tools for checking for colliding booking dates (gems, APIs, etc.).

Any other gem/library that does not solve the task for you is fine with us. :)

Good luck!
